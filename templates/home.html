        </br><b>Upload an Image of Your Skin Concern</b></br>
        <p>You can upload an image of your skin concern. Please check out our “FAQ” page for information on how to
            take the best image for the most accurate prediction. If you receive a low SPF, you may need to retake
            the image.</p>

    <div class="box"><img src="static/media/pin.jpeg" class="boximg"></br></br><b>Receive a Classification for Your Skin Concern</b></br>
        <p>We will run the image through our SkinScreen model to classify your skin concern and provide a SkinScreen
            Prediction Factor (SPF), which tells you how confident we are in the classification. We do not store
            this image in any databases.</p>

        <p>If you input a zip code along with your image, we will give you a list of recommended hospitals in your
            area. These hospitals are not sponsored. We use publicly available data from US News Health on the best
            hospitals.</p>

        <p>There is so much skin health information online, and many skin conditions have similar appearances and
            symptoms, so it can be difficult to narrow down what you need to visit a doctor for and go into the
            appointment feeling informed. We can help with that. With your SkinScreen classification, you can do
            more specific research on the identified skin concern, find doctors that specialize in it, and be more
            informed walking into your appointment.</p>
