                <p>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. It typically arises from the basal
                    cells, which are found in the lowest layer of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Basal cell
                    carcinoma usually develops on areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face,
                    head, neck, and upper torso.</p>
                <p>Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a raised, pink or flesh-colored, translucent bump on the skin. It
                    may also present as a shiny or pearly nodule, a non-healing sore, or a scar-like area. BCCs can
                    sometimes ulcerate or bleed, and they may have visible blood vessels or a crusty surface.</p>
